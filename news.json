    "content": "President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" cleared a key procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate late Saturday night, pushing the massive spending package one step closer to the president's desk.\nThe vote on a motion to proceed to final debate on the bill passed with 51 yeas and 49 nays. Every Democrat and two Republicans, Sens. Thom Tillis, N.C., and Rand Paul, Ky., voted against it.\nThe actual voting took hours and the measure only passed after three Republican holdouts — Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rick Scott of Florida and Cynthia Lummus of Wyoming — folded and voted yes.\nSen. Ron Johnson, Wis., an outspoken critic of the bill, ultimately changed his vote from a \"no\" to a \"yes.\" That additional Republican vote gave the bill 51 yeas, so Vice President JD Vance did not need to cast a vote to break a tie.\nThe ultimate passage was a victory for Republican Majority Leader John Thune, S.D., who has pledged to get the bill to Trump for his signature by July 4.\nBut the hours of uncertainty and last-minute wrangling underscore the tricky path ahead for the controversial package.\nSaturday's procedural vote tees up a final Senate vote on the megabill that will likely happen sometime Sunday or Monday.\nDemocrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are forcing the 940-page bill to be read out loud once it heads to full debate on the Senate floor Sunday.\n\"We will be here all night if that's what it takes to read it,\" Schumer wrote Saturday on X.\nWhile the package cannot officially pass the upper chamber until the final vote, the procedural vote was considered a big test for Thune.\nThe vote comes after weeks of turmoil and tension over the massive package that exposed bitter policy disputes and emboldened some firm Republican holdouts.\nThe sweeping domestic policy package will also have to be passed again in the House, which just narrowly passed its own version of the bill last month.\nSome House Republicans have already expressed opposition to key elements of the Senate version of the bill — most notably deep cuts to Medicaid — likely foreshadowing a close vote in the lower chamber.\nBoth Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson hold narrow majorities in their respective chambers, meaning they can only afford to lose the support of a small number of Republican lawmakers to pass the package in a party-line vote.\nMeanwhile, Trump continues to urge lawmakers to get the package passed before Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline.\n\"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal,\" the White House said in a statement of administration policy on Saturday.\nGot a confidential news tip?

    "title": "France is betting Eutelsat can become Europe's answer to Starlink — but experts aren't convinced",
    "source": "US Top News and Analysis",
    "content": "For years, France's Eutelsat has been trying to build a European alternative to Elon Musk's Starlink satellite broadband service.\nThe company merged with British satellite venture OneWeb in 2023, consolidating the region's satellite communications industry in an effort to catch up to Starlink, which is owned by SpaceX.\nLast week, the French state led a 1.35-billion-euro ($1.58 billion) investment in Eutelsat, making it the company's biggest shareholder with a roughly 30% stake.\nEurope largely lags behind the U.S. in the global space race. Starlink's constellation of over 7,000 satellites dwarfs Eutelsat's. Meanwhile, Europe's launch capabilities are more limited than the U.S. The region still relies heavily on America for certain launch services, which is a market dominated by SpaceX.\nEutelsat currently has a market capitalization of 1.6 billion euros, much lower than estimates for Starlink owner SpaceX's value, which was pegged at $350 billion in a secondary share sale last year. In 2020, analysts at Morgan Stanley said that they see Starlink growing to $80.9 billion in their \"base case valuation\" for the firm.\nLuke Kehoe, industry analyst at network monitoring firm Ookla, said France's investment in Eutelsat shows the country \"is now treating Eutelsat less like a commercial telco and more like a dual-use critical-infrastructure provider\" and a \"strategic asset\" in the European Union's push for technological sovereignty.\nHowever, building a European competitor to Starlink will be no mean feat.\nCommunications industry experts tell CNBC that, while Eutelsat could boost Europe's efforts to create a sovereign satellite internet provider, challenging its U.S. rival Starlink would require a significant increase in investments in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.\nEutelsat's OneWeb arm operates a total of 650 LEO satellites, which is less than a tenth of Starlink's 7,600-strong global satellite constellation.\n\"To offer greater capacity and coverage, [Eutelsat] needs to increase the number of satellites in space, a task made more difficult due to the fact that many of OneWeb's satellites are nearing the end of their lifespan and will need to be first replaced before growing the constellation's size,\" Joe Gardiner, research analyst at market research firm CCS Insight, told CNBC via email.\nOokla's Kehoe echoed this view. \"Eutelsat's chances of achieving parity with Starlink in the mass-market satellite broadband segment within the next five years remain limited, given SpaceX's unmatched global scale in LEO infrastructure,\" he said.\n\"Even with the latest injection of capital from the French state, Eutelsat continues to lag behind Starlink in several key areas, including capital, manufacturing throughput, launch access, spectrum and user terminals.\"\nNevertheless, he thinks the company is \"well positioned to succeed in European-sovereign, security-sensitive and enterprise segments that prioritise jurisdictional control and sovereignty over raw constellation capacity.\" The enterprise segment refers to the market for corporate space clients.\nThat's certainly the hope. France's Emmanuel Macron has urged Europe to ramp up its investment in space, saying last week that \"space has in some way become a gauge of international power.\"\nWhen Eutelsat announced its investment from France last week, the firm stressed its role as \"the only European operator with a fully operational LEO network\" as well as the \"strategic role of the LEO constellation in France's model for sovereign defense and space communications.\"\nEarlier this year, Eutelsat was rumoured to be in the running to replace Starlink in Ukraine. For years, Starlink has offered Ukraine's military its satellite internet services to assist with the war effort amid Russia's ongoing invasion.\nRelations between the U.S. and Ukraine soured following the election of President Donald Trump and reports surfaced that U.S. negotiators had raised the possibility of cutting Ukraine's access to Starlink.\nGermany set up 1,000 Eutelsat terminals in Ukraine in April with the aim of providing an alternative — rather than a replacement — for Starlink's 50,000 terminals in the war-torn country.\nSince then, U.S.-Ukraine tensions have somewhat cooled, and Starlink remains the primary satellite broadband provider to the Ukrainian military.\nEutelsat's former CEO Eva Berneke has herself admitted that the company cannot yet match Starlink's scale.\n\"If we were to take over the entire connectivity capacity for Ukraine and all the citizens — we wouldn't be able to do that. Let's just be very honest,\" she said in an April interview with Politico.\nBerneke was replaced as CEO in May by Jean-Francois-Fallacher, a former executive of French telecoms giant Orange.\nMeanwhile, even though Eutelsat has been ramping up investments in LEO satellite with its OneWeb unit, experts say its technical architectures and orbital designs are ultimately different from Starlink's.\n\"The OneWeb constellation currently uses a bent-pipe architecture, which is not as capable as Starlink satellites; therefore, OneWeb will also need to invest in second-generation satellites,\" he added.\nThe French firm's use cases also differ to Starlink's. Eutelsat operates a constellation of geostationary orbit (GEO) as well as LEO satellites. GEO satellites orbit the earth at a much higher altitude than their LEO equivalents and can typically cover more land with fewer satellites.\n\"Eutelsat's higher altitude satellites are leveraged for specialized use cases, such as polar coverage for companies and research facilities in remote regions like Greenland and Alaska,\" said Joe Vaccaro, vice president and general manager at Cisco's ThousandEyes network intelligence unit.\nLooking ahead, Eutelsat said it plans to \"build upon its operation improvements\" with a \"differentiated go-to-market model\" and \"strong European anchoring.\" It also noted that the U.K. government could also increase its investment in Eutelsat \"in due course.\"\nGot a confidential news tip?

    "content": "HANOI (Reuters) -Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast (NASDAQ:VFS) began production on Sunday at its second domestic factory, aiming to ramp up output of affordable mini urban models as its global expansion plans face delays.\nThe new facility, located in the central province of Ha Tinh, has an initial annual capacity of 200,000 units and spans 36 hectares (90 acres), the company said in a statement.\nBy comparison, VinFast’s flagship factory in northern Haiphong is designed to reach a capacity of 950,000 units by next year.\nVinFast, backed by Vietnam’s largest conglomerate Vingroup, has set ambitious goals to establish production plants in international markets, including the United States, India, and Indonesia. However, it has faced hurdles in its global expansion, including weaker demand and stiff competition.\nThe company announced last year that operations at its U.S. factory would be delayed until 2028. Its India assembly plant is expected to become operational next month.\n\"Once operational, the VinFast Ha Tinh factory will contribute to VinFast’s goal of producing 1 million vehicles per year to meet the increasing demand of domestic and foreign markets,\" said Nguyen Viet Quang, Vingroup’s CEO.\nThe EV maker has set a delivery target of 200,000 cars for 2025, having sold approximately 56,000 units in the first five months, primarily in its domestic market.\nIt reported a net loss of $712.4 million for the first quarter, less than the $1.3 billion loss in the previous quarter but 20% more than a year earlier. Revenue jumped 150% to $656.5 million over the same period.",

    "content": "(Reuters) -Nvidia insiders sold over $1 billion worth of company stock in the past year, with a notable uptick in recent trading activity as executives capitalize on surging investor interest in artificial intelligence, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.\nMore than $500 million of the share sales took place this month as the California-based chips designer’s share price climbed to an all-time high, the report said.\nJensen Huang, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s chief executive, started selling shares this week for the first time since September, the SEC filing showed.\nNvidia’s stock hit a record on Wednesday, and the chipmaker reclaimed the crown as the world’s most valuable company after an analyst said the chipmaker was set to ride a \"Golden Wave\" of artificial intelligence.\nIts latest gains reflect the U.S. stock market’s return to the \"AI trade\" that fueled massive gains in chip stocks and related technology companies in recent years on optimism about the emerging technology.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nNvidia’s shares have rebounded over 60% from their closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump’s global tariff announcements. U.S. stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations the White House will reach trade deals to soften the tariffs.",

    "source": "Stock Market News",
    "content": "VENICE (Reuters) -Newlyweds Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez left their luxury hotel on Venice’s Grand Canal on Saturday for a final night of partying, crowning a three-day star-studded wedding extravaganza.\nBezos, 61, and Sanchez, 55, exchanged rings on Friday evening on the small island of San Giorgio, across the water from Saint Mark’s Square, accompanied by singing from Matteo Bocelli, son of Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.\nBill Gates, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Tom Brady, Jordan’s Queen Rania, Oprah Winfrey, Kris Jenner and Kim and Khloe Kardashian, as well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were among the A-listers present.\nSaturday’s evening bash -- wrapping up celebrations for 200-250 guests estimated to have cost some $50 million -- was due to take place in the Arsenale, a former medieval shipyard in an eastern district of the lagoon city.\nAround 1,000 people marched against the event on Saturday, groups of activists and residents who object to the wedding and to seeing Venice being gift-wrapped for the uber-wealthy.\nSome guests were seen leaving the Gritti Palace hotel in central Venice wearing their pyjamas, sometimes beneath colourful dressing gowns, before boarding small boats to reach the party.\nBezos and Sanchez had a more sober style. He was dressing a black skirt and suit, while she had a soft-colour off-the-shoulder dress. They kissed on the boat while greeting those around them.\nAt the ceremony the bride wore a high-necked silhouette dress and a tulle and lace veil by Dolce & Gabbana, which she told magazine Vogue was based on Sophia Loren’s dress to marry Cary Grant in the 1958 film, Houseboat.\nSanchez was also wearing a pair of diamond earrings by Dolce & Gabbana, which, according to Vogue, was lent to her in keeping with the tradition that it brings good luck for a bride to wear something borrowed.\nBezos, who is No. 4 on Forbes’ global billionaires list, donned a black tuxedo and bow tie over a white shirt.\nFriday’s ceremony had no legal status under Italian law, a senior city hall official told Reuters, suggesting the couple may have previously wed legally in the United States to avoid the bureaucracy associated with an Italian marriage.\nWhile some residents and activists raged against Bezos as a symbol of inequality and arrogance, Venetian businesses and political leaders welcomed the luxury nuptials, hailing them as major boost for the local economy.\n\"Those who protest are in contradiction with the history of Venice, which is a history of relations, contacts and business,\" Mayor Luigi Brugnaro told Reuters.\n\"Bezos embodies the Venetian mentality. He is more Venetian than the protesters,\" said centre-right mayor, adding that he hoped Bezos, who donated 3 million euros ($3.51 million) to local institutions, would return to the city to do business.\nBrugnaro said Bezos had attached no conditions to holding his wedding celebrations in Venice, and City Hall had only learned about his donations after they had already been made.\nBezos, Amazon’s executive chair, got engaged to Sanchez in 2023, four years after the collapse of his 25-year marriage to novelist and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott.",
